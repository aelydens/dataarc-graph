The Landscapes of Settlement project (LoS) has beendirected by Orri Vsteinsson and Adolf Fririksson of the Archaeological Institute of Iceland(FS) since 1992 (continuously since 1996), beginning as a site-focused investigation of theViking age ruins at Hofstair2and progressively expanding into a multi-year, multi-investigator, landscape scaled program researching the whole period of human settlement in the Mvatn basin and nearby districts from historical, archaeological, and environmental perspectives. A recent overview of LoS research is provided by an appropriately multi-authored paper in American Anthropologist"

    "Text":"The 2008 season at Sktustair thus continues the work of the LoS program, building upon past work in the Mvatn region and adding to a substantial body of prior research. Investigations in Mvatnssveit for the past fourteen years have resulted in major excavation programs of both structures and midden deposits at Hofstair, Sveigakot, and Hrsheimar, with smaller scale midden excavations and test trenching at Steinbogi, Selhagi, Oddastair, Brenna, and Thorleifstair combined with a comprehensive foot survey of the district (continued in 2008 by Oscar Aldred and Christian K. Madsen, see their separate report). The LoS program has greatly improved our understanding of the timing and processes of the Viking age Landnm in Iceland, and the value of multiple sites of different social status and local environment tied together by the isochrones provided by the critical V871 and V940 tephra has been clearly demonstrated. The strategy of a long term commitment to research in a single district and the longitudinal perspective provided has become a key element in the research agenda of Historical Ecology and Human Ecodynamics5 , and the LoS is now one of several similar landscape-scaled investigations in the region. In many respects, Mvatnssveit is now one of the most intensively researched and best documented portions of the Norse North Atlantic, and one of a very few Viking Age multi-site cultural landscapes now known anywhere."

    "Text":"However, the LoS has been far more successful in documenting the earlier phases of settlement in Mvatn than the later periods (somewhat reversing the normal situation in Iceland and elsewhere). We actually have far less evidence in Mvatnssveit for the later Middle Ages and early modern periods (ca. 11001850), and nowhere had we found a continuous archaeological record covering the whole period of human settlement in the region. In 2006 we began a cooperative project under the Human and Social Dynamics of Global Change program of US NSF led by Astrid Ogilvie (HSD: Human and Social Dynamics in Mvatnssveit, Iceland, from the Settlement to the Present) aimed at connecting the archaeological record with the historical documents for land use and landscape change with interviews with senior farmers in the district. The archaeology team has been tasked with locating midden deposits contemporary with the historical data sets, and to support the overall objectives of connecting more distant past with the present. In 2006 we did locate early modern deposits at Hofstair and Narfastair, but failed to locate the large and continuous midden deposits needed to link to the large Viking Age collections. In 2007, a larger scale survey project aimed at locating and testing middens (using soil corers and small test trenches) was carried out under the leadership of Orri Vsteinsson with the aim of locating deeper midden deposits extending from recent times to the medieval period. The 2007 survey located and tested middens at multiple sites (Beinistair, Hofstair, Graenavatn, Geirastair, Litla Gotland, Thorleifstair, Baldursheimar, Grmstair) but the key discovery of the 2007 season was made by Arni Einarsson, who observed a patch of erosion at the southern edge of the green field behind the modern farm and church area at Sktustair had exposed a patch of well preserved mammal and fish bones (the site is clearly visible from the Mvatn Science Station). It appeared that one or more pseudo -crater depressions had been filled with cultural deposits, a pattern reminiscent of the use of midden debris to fill natural or cultural holes and depressions seen on other sits. These discoveries led to an initial limited number of cores which indicated the presence of up to 2.5 meters of cultural deposits on the sloping surface of the Sktustair mound. While the LNS were not clearly seen in any core, we did encounter several apparently in situ tephra (possibly V1717 and V 1477) in several cores, and bone was recovered from cores in excellent condition. The modern family at Sktustair was strongly supportive of an excavation project, and a larger investigation of these promising deposits seemed clearly indicated. In 2007, the HSD grant was supplemented by the first field season of the new NABO IPY effort, and plans were made with FS for an expanded cooperative excavation of the Sktustair midden beginning in summer 2008."

Gerdur Benediktsdttir was our hostess at Sktustair and provided warm hospitality and a great deal of practical help and information about the site and its history. The 2008 season was in many respects still exploratory, as we had not test-trenched the site in 2007 and we needed a better understanding of the nature of the apparently deep and rich cultural deposits before committing fully to a large scale multi-season effort at Sktustair.\nThe objectives of the 2008 season were:\nTest deposits at Sktustair for organic preservation and the presence of stratified\nundisturbed midden, preferably extending into early modern times.\nLocate and (if possible) trace tephra horizons horizontally and vertically.\nRecover datable artifacts to confirm period of deposition.\nRecover C14 samples (preferentially domestic animal bone) for AMS C14.\nRecover animal bone collections (archaeofauna) large enough for preliminary\nquantification.\nRecover samples for archaeobotanical (Mike Church) and palaeoentomological (Vronique Forbes) analysis\n"

Coring transects were carried out using Oakfield tube soil corers (as in prior seasons) with visible stratigraphy logged by depth from surface. Excavation and recovery methods followed FSI standards, using single context planning and 100% sieving (4mm dry sieve) of all deposits with standard 10 litre bulk samples also taken for flotation (using the tank provided by Mike Church) from every context as specified in the archaeobotanical sampling protocol- all archaeobotanical samples were floated by the end of the season. Bulk samples were also taken for insect analysis (Veronique). Kubiena tins for soil micromorphology (Val and Ian) and for tephra (Jennifer) were also collected from profiles, and animal bone for AMS C14 was also pulled from selected strata. Photos were digital, using 9.1 megapixel (Fjui FinePix 6200) for record photos and 7.1 megapixel (Canon) for working shots. A digital copy (in MS Excel 07) of the written registers was kept and is curated on DVD and data stick with the full set of photos, journals, logs, and photos of the profiles and overall site plan. All finds and data are now curated at FS in Reykjavik."

    "Text":"Just before we arrived on site, a narrow builders trench had been opened along the West and part of the South wall of the modern house in order to work on siding and insulation. This builders trench struck cultural deposits all around the house, with the deepest deposits close to the SW corner of the modern concrete house. The E-W trench extended roughly 8 m from the middle of the S wall of the house to the SW corner, and the N-S trench also ran about 8 m north of the SW corner of the house. The trench clearly intersected significant cultural deposits, as large pieces of bone (cattle, sheep, fish, bird (both swan and sea eagle) were protruding from what appeared to be rich midden deposits (ash, charcoal, turf ash) running all around the exposed L shaped unit, mainly concentrating at the base of the exposure. This builders trench has proved very useful, providing deep profiles revealing multiple tephra layers (more than any previously recorded from archaeological deposits in Mvatnssveit. The N-S builders trench was designated area E 1 and the E-W trench was designated E 2. This area is cut by both the original construction trench of the modern house (about 50-75 cm from the wall line) and by a narrow trench cut for a water pipe connecting to the sheep house to the south. A second modern utility trench runs just east of the E2 unit. The E 2 area was extended with an approximate 2 x 2 m unit in its east end (stopping short of the second utility cut) to follow the lowermost midden deposits and to begin to bring the E2 profile into alignment with the project6"

    "Text":"The erosion patch observed by Arni in 2007 lay approximately 20 meters to the South of the SW corner of the modern house, at the current edge of the steep slope dropping down to the modern sheep house south of the modern dwelling houses (see site location map next page). This area was designated area D and a 2 X 5 m excavation unit (with a 2 x 40 cm extension to the S to follow the erosion cut) was opened and carried to the original lava rock surface. In unit D it was possible to identify and follow horizontally a dark black tephra (probably V 1717) across the whole unit.\nFurther to the East (downslope) we placed another test unit F, near the edge of the rim of the lowest crater, where some of the deepest cores had been recovered in 2007. This 2 x 3 m unit could not be fit to the site grid because of the orientation of the crater rim, so its precise location is probably best read from the GPS map (also see site sketch plan figure 3 below). Unit F proved to be extremely rich in 19th c deposits, and somewhat surprisingly turned up a clear structure wall near the edge of the crater rim.\n"

    "Text":"A major objective of the 2008 season was an intensive soil coring program aimed at determining maximum depth of cultural deposits (depth to sterile sub soil) and where possible some idea of stratigraphy and possible tephra deposits. While there are significant limits imposed by the field of view of a 3 cm-wide core, and detailed stratigraphic interpretation based entirely upon cores is unwise, the tube corer does provide a rapid and relatively non-destructive way of learning about deposits prior to (or in place of) excavation. The 2007 season coring runs (both scattered judgemental cores and four transects running roughly N-S and E-W) indicated that there was considerable variation in the maximum depth reached and that the natural surface appeared to be rocky volcanic lava throughout. After a few additional judgemental cores, in 2008 we set up a series of transects following the project grid (100 grid series is ~ N-S, 500 series is ~ E-W). Note that since we hit rock at base in every case, it may not always be possible to differentiate cores stopped by rocks above the maximum depth of cultural deposit, but the patterning of the results presents some clear patterns overall. Raw data is in the coring log in the Excel file in the data archive."
